**CivicSathi** 🏙️

Crowdsourced Civic Issue Reporting & Resolution Platform for Smart Cities

**📌 Summary**

CivicSathi is a full-stack civic engagement platform that connects citizens and municipal authorities through a transparent, data-driven workflow for reporting and resolving urban infrastructure issues. The system enables residents to report civic problems in real time, while providing government officials with a centralized dashboard to manage, prioritize, and analyze complaints efficiently.

By combining real-time data ingestion, geospatial visualization, and AI-assisted categorization, CivicSathi transforms fragmented grievance systems into a scalable, smart-city–ready digital solution 

**🧩 System Overview**

CivicSathi is designed as a multi-tier architecture with two primary user-facing applications:

Citizen Web App (User Side) – for reporting and tracking civic issues

Municipal Admin Dashboard – for managing, resolving, and analyzing reported issues

Both interfaces are powered by a shared backend and real-time database, ensuring seamless data flow and transparency across the system.

**👥 CivicSathi – Citizen Reporting Web App 🌍**

A lightweight, intuitive web application that allows citizens to report everyday civic issues such as potholes, garbage overflow, broken streetlights, and water leaks.
